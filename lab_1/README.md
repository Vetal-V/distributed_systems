## Distributed Systems Seminars: Introduction

- To run the application you need to use `Python` version 3.7 or higher. The Python version can be checked by the command:
    ```
    python -V
    ```
- A package management system (`pip`) used to install and manage software packages must also be installed.
- Using package management system you need to install `pipenv` and create an isolated environment for `Python`:
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv --python 3.7
    pipenv shell
    ```
- By going to the virtual environment you can execute the program:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
